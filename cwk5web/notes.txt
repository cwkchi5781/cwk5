Different type of divs:

<header></header>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
<nav></nav>

The positives of using these tag names is that web crawling bots will look that the text inside of these sections.
This makes a website more likely to show up on a google search when you want it too.

Web crawlers also look at the title tag inside of the header tag

Javascript Rant:

setTimeout(function, time in milliseconds)
    a function that makes the computer wait before running the inputted function adress by making a timer. 
    This is NOT a delay because a delay would stop all other code during the wait time but this does not. 


jQuery notes:
    $(document).ready()
        This tells the html script in jQuery to wait until the html is loaded before loading all of the javascript
        This means you have to put all of the code in between the ()s.
        
    $(divName).html(content)
        var content = string
            sets the inner html of a div 
    
    $(divName).css(content)
        var content = css code 
            sets in the css of tags
            ex: $('p').css("background-color", "yellow");
            ex: $("p").css({"background-color": "yellow", "font-size": "200%"})

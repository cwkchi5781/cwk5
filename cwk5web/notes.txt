Different type of divs:

<header></header>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
<nav></nav>

The positives of using these tag names is that web crawling bots will look that the text inside of these sections.
This makes a website more likely to show up on a google search when you want it too.

Web crawlers also look at the title tag inside of the header tag
